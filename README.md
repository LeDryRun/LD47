A poor mining ship traveling through dangerous space, at the mercy of an onslaught of enemies - but you have no weapons! Draw loops around your foes' firepower to give them a taste of their own medicine. Struggle to survive against procedurally generated waves of enemies.

Made for the Ludum Dare 47 game jam. The theme was Stuck in a Loop.

Made by a group of 4 in a custom engine built with SFML:

Horus Vidal
Andrew Advani
Alex Pacheco
Daniel Muzkiz (Biohazard335)
